# Finding App Passwords in Google Account

## The Issue
App Passwords doesn't show on the main security page - it's **inside** the 2-Step Verification settings.

## Solution: Click INTO 2-Step Verification

1. **Click on "2-Step Verification"** (the one that says "On since Jul 12, 2024")
   - Don't just look at it - actually click on it to open the settings

2. **Scroll down** in the 2-Step Verification page
   - Look for a section called **"App passwords"** or **"App-specific passwords"**
   - It's usually at the bottom of that page

3. **Alternative Direct Link:**
   - Try this direct link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - (You might need to sign in again)

## If Still Not Showing

**Option 1: Use a Personal Account**
- App Passwords might not be available for Google Workspace accounts
- If `info@usillustrations.com` is a Google Workspace account, you might need to:
  - Use a personal Gmail account instead, OR
  - Contact your Google Workspace admin to enable App Passwords

**Option 2: Check Account Type**
- Personal Gmail accounts: App Passwords available ✅
- Google Workspace accounts: May require admin approval ⚠️

## Quick Test
Try visiting this direct link while signed in:
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

If it says "App passwords aren't available for your account", then it's a Google Workspace limitation.
